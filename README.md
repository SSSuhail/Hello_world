# Hello_world
Testing Repository
While it's true that Bitbucket and Github use different underlying systems, I feel like that's the least interesting difference between them.

The two services have very different billing structures, for example -- GH charges per private repo, BB charges per private collaborator.

Also, their issue tracking, wiki, history viewer and collaboration features work pretty differently. At this point in May 2011, Github's are a little more mature, but Bitbucket has been making a lot of improvements to the site since they got bought by Atlassian.

(Aside: Ultimately, I think Bitbucket integration in JIRA going to be huge for both Bitbucket and Atlassian, and something along those lines is probably why they bought it in the first place.)

So, yeah, don't just compare BB and GH based on git vs hg -- they are honestly very, very similar systems (although git is a little crustier IMO). Compare what the sites are actually bringing to the table -- billing plans, issue tracking, wiki, collaboration features, etc.
